1. Jenkins is a Java application, so the first step is to install Java. Run the following command to install the OpenJDK 8 package
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

2. The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository. To do that, import the GPG key using the following curl command:
curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

And add the repository to your system with:
rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

3. Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing:
yum install jenkins

4. Start the jenkins service
systemctl start jenkins

5. Enable the jenkins service
systemctl enable jenkins

6. Verify the status of the jenkins service
systemctl status jenkins

7. Make sure the port 8080 is forwarded in the vagrant file if not done already enable the forwarding and run 
vagrant provision

8. At this point the you can access the jenkins in the browser as 
192.168.1.7:8080

9. Jenkins has the password at the following location , you can read the password on the server and enter on the installation to proceed further
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Enter the password in the browser to continue with the installation further.

10. Select the install the suggested plugins
plugins installation should start at this point

11. Next enter your username and password this would be used by default to login to the jenkins 

12. You need to click on continue as admin as it creates the account otherwise it will error out

13. Input the jenkins url on which the jenkins will load in our case its
http://192.168.1.7:8080/

14. If somehow your user was not created than admin account created by default and password would be the same as created in the initialAdminPassword file
you can use that to login to the jenkins

15. At this point you should be able to login to the jenkins server with the admin user and password.
